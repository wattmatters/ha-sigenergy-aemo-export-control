# SIGEN – AEMO Critical Event Export Control

A Home Assistant automation **shared as an example** for Sigenergy energy controller owners in the Australian NEM who want to automatically maximise battery export during AEMO critical price events. It is posted here as a reference to adapt to your own system — not as a plug-and-play solution.

The automation was developed and tested on a specific system (see [Tested on](#known-limitations--notes)) and makes assumptions about time windows, helper entities, and operating modes that reflect that setup. You will almost certainly need to modify it to suit your own tariff schedule, inverter configuration, and broader Home Assistant automations.

---

## What it does

- **Detects AEMO critical price events** in real time using the AEMO NEM Web HACS integration
- **Pre-alerts** based on the 5-minute forecast price before an event officially starts
- **Automatically switches your SIGEN battery to maximum export mode** when a critical event is detected, subject to configurable time windows and a minimum battery reserve
- **Monitors every minute** during an active event to handle edge cases (battery depletion, Remote EMS turning off, export rate dropping)
- **Restores your normal operating mode** when the event ends, with context-aware handling for solar charging windows and peak export periods — *these time windows are specific to the author's system and will need adjusting*
- **Sends persistent notifications** at every state change so you always know what's happening

### Logic overview

```
Critical event detected?
  └─ Sufficient battery (>5 kWh)?
       ├─ Already exporting at max during peak window? → No action needed
       ├─ Solar/charging window (e.g. 11am–2pm) AND EMS on? → Override to export
       ├─ Remote EMS off? → Enable EMS, set export mode
       ├─ EMS on but export rate low? → Increase to maximum
       └─ Battery too low? → Notify only, don't export

Event ends?
  ├─ During solar window → Restore charging mode
  ├─ During peak window → Stay in export (no change needed)
  └─ Otherwise → Return to Maximum Self-consumption
```

## Requirements

### Hardware — SIGEN inverter integration

This automation requires a Home Assistant integration for your SIGEN inverter. There are two common options; sensor naming differs between them, so you will need to identify the correct entity IDs in your own instance using **Developer Tools → States**.

#### Option A: sigenergy2mqtt (add-on)
[seud0nym/home-assistant-addons](https://github.com/seud0nym/home-assistant-addons/tree/main/sigenergy2mqtt) — a Mosquitto/MQTT-based add-on. This is the integration used when developing and testing this automation. Entity names follow the pattern used throughout this YAML (e.g. `sigen_0_plant_...`, `sigen_0_inverter_1_...`).

#### Option B: Sigenergy Local Modbus (HACS)
[TypQxQ/Sigenergy-Local-Modbus](https://github.com/TypQxQ/Sigenergy-Local-Modbus) — a HACS integration using local Modbus polling. Entity naming may differ from the examples in this YAML; use Developer Tools → States to find your equivalents.

Whichever integration you use, you need entities that expose:

| Function | Example entity (sigenergy2mqtt) | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| Remote EMS toggle | `switch.sigen_0_plant_remote_ems` | A switch controlling remote EMS / grid export mode |
| Grid export limit | `number.sigen_0_plant_grid_max_export_limit` | A number entity for max grid export in kW |
| Max charge rate | `number.sigen_0_plant_max_charging_limit` | A number entity for max charge rate in kW |
| Operating mode | *(select entity)* | A select with options like Self-consumption, Command Charging, Command Discharging |
| Available discharge energy | `sensor.sigen_0_inverter_1_available_battery_discharge_energy` | A sensor for usable battery energy in kWh |

### HACS Integrations
- [**AEMO NEM Web**](https://github.com/pvandenh/aemo_nemweb) — install via HACS, providing:
  - `sensor.aemo_nemweb_<REGION>_realtime_price` ($/MWh)
  - `sensor.aemo_nemweb_<REGION>_5min_forecast` ($/MWh)
  - Replace `nsw1` in the YAML with your region: `vic1`, `sa1`, `qld1`, etc.

### Helper Entities
Create these in **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers** before importing the automation:

| Entity | Type | Suggested default |
|---|---|---|
| `input_number.aemo_critical_threshold` | Number | 3.0 (= $3,000/MWh) |
| `input_number.aemo_pre_alert_threshold` | Number | 2.0 (= $2,000/MWh) |
| `input_number.aemo_nsw_spot_price` | Number | 0 (updated automatically) |
| `input_boolean.aemo_critical_event` | Toggle | — |
| `input_boolean.aemo_critical_override_active` | Toggle | — |
| `input_boolean.aemo_pre_alert` | Toggle | — |
| `input_boolean.battery_export_enabled` | Toggle | — |
| `input_number.battery_charge_suggested_rate` *(optional)* | Number | your normal charge rate (kW) |

### Optional: charge rate integration

`input_number.battery_charge_suggested_rate` is an **optional integration point** for users who have a separate automation that calculates an optimal battery charge rate (for example, based on a solar forecast, time-of-use tariff, or Amber Electric pricing). When a critical event ends during the solar/charging window, this automation reads that helper and restores whatever charge rate it recommends, rather than using a fixed value.

If you don't have such an automation, you have two options:
- **Create the helper anyway** and set it to your preferred fixed charge rate in kW — the automation will simply always restore to that value
- **Edit the YAML** and replace the template in the "Charging Restored" branch with a plain `value: X` (where X is your charge rate in kW), removing the dependency entirely

## Installation

1. **Create all helper entities** listed above.

2. **Copy `sigen_aemo_critical_event_export_control.yaml`** to your Home Assistant `config/automations/` directory, or paste its contents into the **Automation editor → Edit in YAML** view.

3. **Find and replace all `← REPLACE` placeholders** in the YAML:

   - **AEMO region**: change `nsw1` to your NEM region (`vic1`, `sa1`, `qld1`, `tas1`)
   - **SIGEN device_id**: open the SIGEN device page in HA, copy the device ID from the URL (`/config/devices/device/<id>`)
   - **SIGEN entity IDs**: use Developer Tools → States to find the exact IDs for your Remote EMS switch and operating mode select entity
   - **Time windows**: adjust the `after`/`before` times in the `critical_event_start` and `critical_event_end` branches to match your tariff schedule and solar generation window
   - **Export/charge limits**: change the `value: 5` entries to match your inverter's actual maximum export capacity and your preferred settings

4. **Reload automations** (Developer Tools → YAML → Reload Automations), or restart Home Assistant.

## How thresholds work

Prices from the AEMO NEM Web integration are reported in **$/kWh**. The automation multiplies these by 1,000 to convert to the more familiar **$/MWh** figures used in AEMO market reporting — so a sensor value of `0.003` becomes `$3/MWh` for display purposes. The `input_number` threshold helpers use the same $/MWh scale, so set `input_number.aemo_critical_threshold` to `3000` if you want to trigger at $3,000/MWh. Adjust to suit your VPP agreement or personal threshold for when exporting makes financial sense.

The **pre-alert** triggers on the 5-minute forecast, giving you advance warning before the realtime price crosses the critical threshold. It doesn't change inverter behaviour — it just sets a flag and sends a notification so you can keep an eye on battery SoC.

## Notifications

The automation sends persistent notifications to your HA dashboard for every state change:

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Event ended or no action needed |
| ⚡ | Override active, exporting to grid |
| ⚠️ | Pre-alert or insufficient battery |
| 🛑 | Export stopped due to low battery |

---

## Known limitations / notes

- The automation is written for **SIGEN inverters** and uses device-action calls (by `device_id`) for the operating mode select. These cannot be replaced with simple entity service calls — you must supply your own `device_id`.
- Time windows are hardcoded. If your tariff windows change seasonally, update them accordingly or consider converting to `input_datetime` helpers.
- The automation assumes a **5 kW maximum export limit**. Adjust if your inverter or DNSP export limit differs.
- Tested on **Home Assistant OS 17.3 / Core 2026.5.2 / Supervisor 2026.05.0** with a **Sigenergy 12 kW Single Phase Energy Controller** in the NSW NEM region, using the **sigenergy2mqtt** add-on integration.
